# todo: OPTIONAL community m√∂glichkeiten?
# todo: RestAPI and UI for Input and Result visualization
# todo: coords: set coords for compare clubs specifically
# todo: add missing nodes (bspw. ist AFC Ajax nicht vorhanden!, vermutlich weil nur outdegrees!)  absent nodes!!!!!
# todo: comparison options: additional transfer expense and transfer income (ratio already done)
# info: comparison of transfer income / expense https://www.transfermarkt.ch/statistik/einnahmenausgaben
# use case: e.g. Paris SG, at what specific time, was Paris SG bought by rich guys? (compare season before and after witch comparison option transfer expense)
